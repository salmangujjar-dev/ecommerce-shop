# BuildAStore Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **Project Updated!**

Your **BuildAStore** ecommerce platform has been updated with your new official logo.

## üèóÔ∏è **Logo Implementation**

### **Logo Asset**

- **Primary Logo**: `/public/logo.png` - The official logo you provided.

### **Logo Integration**

- **Header Navigation**: Updated to use the new logo.
- **Mobile Navigation**: Updated with the new logo.
- **Footer**: Updated to use the new logo.
- **React Component**: The `Logo` component at `src/components/ui/logo.tsx` has been updated to use `logo.png`.
- **Brand Demo**: The page at `/brand-demo` now showcases the new logo.

## üìÅ **Files Modified**

### **Logo Component**

- `src/components/ui/logo.tsx`: Modified to load `logo.png` and adjusted for a square aspect ratio.

### **Application Components**

- `src/components/common/Header/index.tsx`: Updated to use the new `Logo` component.
- `src/components/common/Header/MobileNavigation.tsx`: Updated to use the new `Logo` component.
- `src/components/page/Home/Footer/index.tsx`: Updated to use the new `Logo` component.
- `src/app/(application)/brand-demo/page.tsx`: Rewritten to showcase the new logo.

### **Assets Deleted**

- All previous `.svg` logo and branding images in `public/` have been removed.

## üéØ **Next Steps**

### **1. Verify the Logo**

- Please make sure you have saved your logo as `public/logo.png`. The application now depends on this file path.

### **2. Create a Favicon**

- You will need to generate a `favicon.ico` file from your new logo and place it in the `public/` directory for it to show up in browser tabs.

### **3. Consider a Light-Background Version**

- The footer has a dark background where your logo currently appears. You may want to create a version of your logo with inverted or white colors for use on dark backgrounds. If you do, you can save it as `public/logo-white.png` and I can help you update the code to use it in the right places.

### **4. Update Social Media Images**

- The `og-image.png` (for Facebook, etc.) and `twitter-image.png` used for social media sharing should be recreated using your new logo. You should place the new versions in the `public/` directory.
